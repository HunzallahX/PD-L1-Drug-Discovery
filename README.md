\# Header 1 ** Machine Learning-Guided Discovery of Small Molecule Inhibitors Targeting PD-L1 for Cancer Immunotherapy **

This repository holds the computational pipeline created to accelerate drug discovery, specifically for PDL1 as the target molecule.This approach aims to overcome the 
limitations of monoclonal antibodies by developing candidates with advantages like improved tumor penetration and the possibility of oral administration.
